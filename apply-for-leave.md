- Sick or any emergency leaves allowed to be applied on the same date. It is expected that at least you inform your PM or any other team member who might be dependent on you on slack.

Note: It is NOT required for you to specify the reason of the leave. We believe to stay productive and avoid burn out we need breaks. An we encourage to take them. It's just if it is well informed the project deliveries won't hit.
