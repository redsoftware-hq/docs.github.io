# SCRUM SOP

### WHY SCRUM
- To plan out the tasks effectively
- To provide the maximum information right before the developers start working on the project
- To estimate the effort effectively
- To get the definite deadline

### Stakeholders
- Project Manager (PM)
- Developers

_As of now we are not considering designer as a part of SCRUM. They will directly work with the client (in coodination with the PM) to finalize the requirement._

## Process

### Preparing the requirements
- PM will create all the tasks on the Click Up under **TO DO**. If the requirement is yet not final, PM can use the _DRAFT_ status and keep the issues there.
- The tasks are expected to have following template
  - Title
  - Description with acceptance criteria as checklist


### Developers will review tasks before sprint planning
- As soon as the PM it ready with preparing the tasks s/he will update in the slack project channel that the tasks are ready and available for developer to review.
- PM and developers should mutually agree how much time to allocate for this tasks review.
- Developer can understand the requirement and put in comment what appraoch they are about to take to solve it
- If any questions developers have then they should ask in the comments. 
- PM should address the questions if developer have any
- Once the requirement is reviewed by the developers they should meet for the sprint planning meeting.

### Sprint Planning
- PM and Developer will at preddecide the timing. Ideally it should not take more than 45mins.
- They should estimate each task on the basis of Fibonacci series (1,2,3,5,8) In which 8 should be avoided. Do take is as Number, rather you can consider they simbolize the siuze of t-shirt like (1-XS,2-S,3-M,5-L,8-XL)
- Estimate using the https://app.storypoint.poker/ (PM will host this game)
- Come to a mutual agreement how many points we want to take in the defined sprint. (One sprint should be of one week if there are <=2 devs. If more devs are there then we can go for 2 weeks longer sprint) 
- Start the sprint

### Standup Meeting
Every developer has to answer answer to following 3 questions:
  - To complete the sprint on <date>, what did I completed today?
  - To complete the sprint on <date>, what will I do tomorrow?
  - To complete the sprint on <date>, do I have any impediments?
Ideally Meeting should not take more that 10 mins.

### Ending the Sprint
Ideally sprint should not be extended then the specified date.

### Sprint Review Meeting
It should be organized right after completing the sprint.
