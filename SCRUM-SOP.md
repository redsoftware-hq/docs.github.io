# SCRUM SOP

## Maintainer

- Sanket Patel
- Jayati Agarwal

## WHY SCRUM

- To plan out the tasks effectively
- To provide the maximum information right before the developers start working on the project
- To estimate the effort effectively
- To get the definite deadline

## Stakeholders

- Project Manager (PM)
- Developers

_As of now we are not considering designer as a part of SCRUM. They will directly work with the client (in coodination with the PM) to finalize the requirement._

## Process

### Preparing the requirements

- PM will create all the tasks on the Click Up under **TO DO**. If the requirement is yet not final, PM can use the _DRAFT_ status and keep the issues there.
- The tasks are expected to have following template
  - Title
  - Description with acceptance criteria as checklist

### Developers will review tasks before sprint planning

- As soon as the PM it ready with preparing the tasks s/he will update in the slack project channel that the tasks are ready and available for developer to review.
- PM and developers should mutually agree how much time to allocate for this tasks review.
- As per discussion PM should update the Sprint meeting time in the channel.
- Developer can understand the requirement and put in comment what approach they are about to take to solve it
- If any questions developers have then they should ask in the comments.
- PM should address the questions if developer have any
- Once the requirement is reviewed by the developers they should meet for the sprint planning meeting.

### Sprint Planning

- PM and Developer will meet at preddecide the timing. Ideally it should not take more than 45mins.
- They should estimate each task on the basis of Fibonacci series (1,2,3,5,8) In which 5 & 8 should be avoided. The estimation are not hours rather consider the numbers symbolize the size of t-shirt like (1-XS,2-S,3-M,5-L,8-XL)
- Estimate using the https://app.storypoint.poker/ (PM will host this game)
- Come to a mutual agreement how many points we want to take in the defined sprint. (One sprint should be of one week if there are <=2 devs. If more devs are there then we can go for 2 weeks longer sprint)
- Start the sprint

### Standup Meeting

Every developer has to answer answer to following 3 questions:

- To help the team to complete the sprint on <deadline date>, what did I completed today?
- To help the team to complete the sprint on <deadline date>, what will I do tomorrow?
- To help the team to complete the sprint on <deadline date>, do I have any impediments?
  Ideally Meeting should not take more that 10 mins.

### Ending the Sprint

Ideally sprint should not be extended then the specified date. Once done PM should declare the Sprint review meeting time in channel.

### Sprint Review Meeting

It should be organized right after completing the sprint.

The very first rule of the same is _to be open minded_. This is not to find the anyone's fault but rather the we want to evaluate the process and find as team when we legged if we missed the deadline.

If we achieved the deadline then how many additional story points we can try adding in the next sprint.

Also the meeting should conclude with one improvement that we think we should make in the next sprint. This improvement should be discussed in sprint planning and should be evaluated in the review meeting whether we followed or not.

Initially the process may be overwhelming as it's a new change. But keep faith on it. Worlds's biggest softwares are being made using this process. And with everyone's support we will surely make it smoother.
